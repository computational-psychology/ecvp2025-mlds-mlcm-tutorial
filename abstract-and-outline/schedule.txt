total 2:30 minutes - 13:30 - 16:00

--
Part 1: intro about the methods
- concept of perceptual scale, aim of the methods. 
- classification: in 1D for MLDS, more-D: MLCM (Einordnung)

Part 2: MLDS:
- assumed observer model
- how to design an MLDS experiment

--
Exercise 1: 
- MLDS experiment with numerosity. Students collect their own data for 1 - 2 blocks (max 5 minutes)
(already prepared with pyscript). 
- Download data and load in R. Inspect data with R, head(), tail()

--
MLDS (cont.)
- Estimation with R package, plotting, extraction of scale values, confidence intervals. Syntax

--
Exercise 2: 
- estimate MLDS with collected data. Plot scales

--
Part 3: MLCM
- assumed observer model. Models: independent, additive, saturated.
- how to design an MLCM experiment. Paired comparisons. Example.

--

Exercise: 
- Same demo as before, but now with numerosity and another dimension (type of marker? color?)
All in one exercise: collect data with already prepared experiment, download data, load in R, estimate scales and plot

--

Part 4: Outro
- other assumptions not explicitely stated before
- practical recommendations. sampling.
